**Problem statement :**
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

**Objective:**
1.Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). 2.Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not. 3.Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.

This dataset has been referred from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

**Data description**
Below are the description of the features in the data:

1.Survival: 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived

2.Pclass: Ticket class where 1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class. This can also be seen as a proxy for socio-economic status.
3.Sex: Male or female
4.Age: Age in years, fractional if less than 1
5.SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the titanic
6.Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the titanic
7.Ticket: Passenger ticket number
8.Fare: Passenger fare
9.Cabin: Cabin number
10.Embarked: Point of embarkation where C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
